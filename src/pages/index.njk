<p>Hi, I'm Suzen Fylke! You can call me Sue. I'm a machine learning engineer,
open source contributor, and language learning enthusiast.
I sometimes build tiny projects as active learning exercises.
Most of my projects are available on <a href="https://github.com/codesue">GitHub</a>.
Some are also on the <a href="https://huggingface.co/codesue">ðŸ¤— Hub</a>.</p>
<p>I write about what I'm learning and building on this blog.</p>

<h2 id="latest-posts" tabindex="-1">
