Hi, I'm Suzen Fylke! You can call me Sue. Iâ€™m a machine learning engineer,
open source contributor, and language learning enthusiast.
I sometimes build tiny projects as active learning exercises.
Most of my projects are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/codesue).
Some are also on the [ðŸ¤— Hub](https://huggingface.co/codesue).

I write about what I'm learning and building on this blog.
