# DEVELOPMENT

## Features

Supports most (if not all) features of [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) v8.

ðŸ’¡ Could be extended to include:

- automatic open graph image generation
- commenting via embeds (giscus, webmentions) or discussion link
- more granular code syntax highligting
- code block copy button
- `unicode-range` to reduce font file size

## Getting Started

### 0. Configure git to recurse submodules by default

Blog posts are stored in a separate repo and are made available here as a
submodule. This allows supported git commands to update submodules by default.

```
git config --global submodule.recurse true
```

If you don't want to recurse submodules by default, you can use the flag
`--recurse-submodules` as needed.

### 1. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/codesue/blog.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the directory

```
cd blog
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### 4. Build and run on a local development server

```
npm start
```

## Next steps

Edit config and content files. If editing posts, commit and push your changes to
the submodule's repo directly, then update the blog repo using
`git submodule update --remote`.

When you're happy with all your changes, refer
to the Eleventy docs for [deployment instructions](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/deployment/).

The website is configured to deploy to Netlify on new commits to the main branch
of this repo.
